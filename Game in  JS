Before the game, you can adjust the number of cards on the field. To do this, 
first I show the form with the "Select the number of cards" 
field and the "Start game" button. 
You can enter an even number from 2 to 10. 
If the value is incorrect (that is, odd or not within the range of 2-10), 
then when you press the button, it is reset to the default value (4).

You can turn on a 1 minute timer, after which the game ends immediately, 
even if all the cards are not open yet.
